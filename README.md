Graceful degradation and service workers are related because of their focus on enhancing user experiences. Graceful Degradation is when you try to implement your software to give the best experience with the most modern technology and then still function with later versions but not to the extent that it does with the newest tech. This is similar to service workers because we usually expect people to have internet access and various other features. However, in the case that some users do not have these things we include service workers to make sure that core functionality is not compromised.
